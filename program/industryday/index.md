<h1>Industry Day @ MODELS</h1>

In combination with the main conference, MODELS’18 is organizing for the first time a 1-day event dedicated to industry. Tailor made for the IT model industry, the program will feature talks by industry speakers, in which selected prominent speakers will paint a comprehensive overview of modelling, describe examples of industrial use of modelling techniques and tools, and showcase the last advancements of modelling technologies.


The Industry Day at MODELS’18 is a unique opportunity to interact with the world’s leading practitioners, architects, researchers, and students of advanced software engineering techniques. In addition to the Industry Day, MODELS’18 includes a rich program, including keynotes, Research and Practice & Innovation tracks, workshops, tutorials, symposia, etc. This edition of the MODELS conference is hosted at the IT University of Copenhagen, the Denmark’s most industry-friendly university. 


Since the Industry Day is fully part of MODELS’18, participants will have to register through the <a href="https://modelsconf2018.github.io/attending/registration/">MODELS registration system</a>.

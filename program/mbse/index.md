# Model-Based Systems Engineering Meeting @ MODELS 2018
## Tuesday October, 16th 2018

## Abstract 

Model-Driven Engineering has contributed significantly to software engineering and the current state of the art in terms of tools and techniques shows a level of maturity that makes its adoption in fields other than software possible.
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is both an experimented area and a current high topic of interest in software-intensive systems such as automotive or complex systems.
This year MODELS will host a dedicated meeting on MBSE that will explore the specifics of Systems Engineering when it comes to modeling, with industrial invited talks and hopefully fruitful discussions between practitioners and academics on the current working solutions and remaining challenges.

## Registration

Since the MBSE meeting is fully part of MODELS'18, participants will have to register through the MODELS registration system.

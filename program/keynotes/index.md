<h2> Silvija Seres - Incremental and disruptive models for business development</h2>
<img align="left" src="/assets/faces/sseres.jpg" alt="Silvija Seres" class="team-face" style="margin-right: 20px"/> 
 
<p>This talk will focus on addressing the current lack of strategies for future business models in face of rapid technological change. The narrative of finding and keeping a position sustainable competitive  advantage breaks when dominant strategic positions shift in a matter of months, driven by new business models and new critical resources, such as good clean data and sharp analytic tools.
<br>
<br>
Most board members, just as most owners and leaders, still think in terms of the previous industrial revolution, and attempt to regain competitive positions by incremental improvements to their production or marketing processes, while the new players uninhibitedly accumulate the real competitive advantages. Most incumbents are in a paradoxical position where their proprietary data and their unique understanding of critical processes present a strategis liability, while it should and could be used as a clear advantage. Old models of good leadership forces them to think, in Henry Ford's terms, of ever faster horses rather than new vehicles and infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
We'll outline a simple model for constructive strategies for the future, built on three levels: new efficiencies, new business drivers, and new externalities.
<br>
<br>
This is not a research-based talk, but rather a set of observations from an ex-academic techie's wanderings in the world of business, board rooms and investment partnerships.

<h2> Jim Cordy - Genetics of Computer Programs</h2>

<p> 
Language use vectors (LUVs) encode the vocabulary and frequency of programming language 
feature use by computer programs and applications. In some sense, they encode the potential 
and expressed vocabulary of a program in a way analogous to the way that the genome (DNA) 
and phenome (RNA) describe the potential and expressed properties of a living thing. 
In this talk I will explore this analogy and its potential for predicting hidden properties of programs,
models and applications such as changes, faults and security flaws.

<h3> Bio </h3>
James R. Cordy is Professor and past Director of the School of Computing at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and Director of the NSERC CREATE Graduate Specialization in Ultra-Large Scale Software Systems.  From 1995 to 2000 he was Vice President and Chief Research Scientist at Legasys Corporation, a software technology company specializing in legacy software system analysis and renovation.  As leader of the TXL source transformation project with hundreds of academic and industrial users worldwide, he has been involved in computer software analysis and transformation systems for more than 30 years.  

Dr. Cordy has published more than 200 refereed contributions in software engineering, programming languages and artificial intelligence, an in the past five years has been invited as keynote speaker at the IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, the IEEE International Conference on Software Product Lines, the International Workshop on Automotive Software Architecture, and the International Workshop on Open and Original Problems in Software Language Engineering. He serves widely as member and chair of conferences, workshops and evaluation committees in software engineering, and has received multiple Best Reviewer awards. 

Dr. Cordy is a Senior Member of the IEEE, a Distinguished Scientist of the Association for Computing Machinery and an IBM Visiting Scientist and Faculty Fellow. He was recognized as IBM Centre for Advanced Studies Faculty Fellow of the Year in both 2009 and 2013.  In 2008 he received the Queen’s University Award for Excellence in Graduate Supervision, and in 2016 the Queen’s University Prize for Excellence in Research.

In recent years Dr. Cordy’s research group has concentrated on similarity in software systems, with particular application to model-driven systems in Simulink using the SIMONE near-miss model clone detector. Most recently, he has been studying profiles of language feature use in transformation languages such as TXL and ATL, with an eye to informing the future of model transformation systems.

<h2> Martijn Wisse -  Models for motion prediction; robotic brains versus biological brains</h2>
<img align="left" src="/assets/faces/mwisse.jpg" alt="Martijn Wisse" class="team-face" style="margin-right: 20px;" />
 
This talk will focus on robot and animal motions. For any system in the real world (robots, animals, and humans alike), for any task that they need to execute, the world needs to be predictable. Accurate predictions facilitate anticipation, planning, and optimization. And predictions are made with a model, i.e. a description of (relevant parts of) the world written in a well-defined language. So the key question for this talk is which models and which modelling language are used by robots and by the biological brain, and is there any similarity between the two?
<br>
<br>
We will first review which models and which language are used for the prediction of dynamic motions for robots. We will survey the basics of (systems of) differential equations illustrated with our work on walking robots, self-driving cars, robotic arms, hands, and integrated systems for logistic applications (the "Amazon Picking Challenge").
<br>
<br>
Next, in this presentation we survey the reigning neuroscientific theories for how the brain does modelling and prediction. Prediction will appear to play a deep fundamental role in all of our brain functions, and we will analyse how this is related to the robot approach; the brain has no processing unit for matrix multiplications or differential equations, so how does the brain do dynamic prediction?
<br>
<br>
Finally, we will share a preliminary breakthrough result termed "Dualistic Prediction Error Minimization", a key insight from the brain's ways of prediction error minimization, which will allow for a tremendous improvement in modelling accuracy for our future complex robot systems that require predictability within a complex environment.

<h3> Bio </h3>
Martijn Wisse is Professor of Biorobotics and Director of the Robotics Institute at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. He has co-founded the TU Delft Robotics Institute, the robotics ecosystem “RoboValley”, and the two successful spin-off companies Lacquey (now FTNON Lacquey) and Fizyr. He served as the coordinator of the EU FP7 project “Factory-in-a-Day” and currently coordinates the EU H2020 project “ROSIN” which focuses on the open-source robot software framework ROS-Industrial.  

The research of prof. Wisse has led from passive dynamic two-legged walking robots via biologically inspired underactuated robot hands and arms to the use of ROS-Industrial and deep learning for intelligent industrial robot systems. A recent highlight was winning the 2016 edition of the Amazon Picking Challenge which required the combination of 3D vision, object recognition, motion planning, and robust localization. Currently, prof. Wisse is working in the field of Active Inference, where he aims to combine information-theoretic models of the neural operations of the biological brain with practical implementations in embodied robots. The ultimate aim is to give the robots an automated way to infer models of themselves and their environment, and simultaneously to learn how to control themselves, in order to maximize their success at predicting their future sensor inputs.
